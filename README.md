# quizlet-app

Several months ago, Elshod, Ms. Bakhtigul, Ms. Nodira, Ms. Madinabonu, and I completed a learning project using Jakarta EE. This project, Quizlet, was just as amazing as it was interesting.
With Quizlet, you can easily learn new terms by saving them into our system and taking quizzes whenever you want. These quizzes are organized to analyze your overall performance based on your latest test scores and individual answers. If you struggle with certain terms, Quizlet automatically detects your weaknesses and generates a special quiz to help you improve. This process is automatic and highly accurate.
In addition to these features, you can also organize your modules into folders to keep your board clean and neat. Furthermore, you can monitor your last test scores to track your progress.
Overall, Quizlet is a very interesting project that has helped us learn and improve our skills. The platform is user-friendly and offers several useful features to enhance the learning experience.


Otabek Eshpo'latov, Leader of this project.
